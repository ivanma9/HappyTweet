				#Thoughts
				<p>
					As we have mentioned, social media is an extremely central part of today’s world. 
					We were initially interested in how this can impact people’s mental states after learning
					more about the various studies that have suggested that social media might impact people’s
					lives negatively. A Times article cites a 2017 study by researchers Vannuci et al. that found
					that increased time on social media was connected to higher levels of anxiety (Heid). The same
					article also brings up the idea or “technology overload” (Heid). More time spent on our phones
					on these social media platforms are thought to not be very healthy for your brain. Thus, there
					is some basis for the idea that social media can negatively affect people’s mental states, which
					justifies our project’s aim to explore how emotions might be reflected in social media.

				#Inspiration
				<p>
					The structure of this project was inspired by other researchers who have done Twitter analysis
					as well. A common project approach we discovered in our research was one that centered around 
					sentiment analysis. These project designs, such as the instructions offered here, used different
					methods to collect tweets and assign different numerical scores to them, depending on if they were
					more positive, negative, or neutral. We applied this idea by searching for tweets in Twarc that 
					were more positive (tweets with the words “happy” and “love” in them), neutral (tweets with the 
					words “okay” and “alright” in them), and negative (tweets with the words “sad” and”hate” in them).
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This Word Mapper project  as well as this also inspired us to use Twarc to create our own dataset
					and locate our own Tweets. This project allows you to type in any word and see where tweets relating
					to that term have been tweeted. By following this same idea and using Twarc, we were able to incorporate
					not just data centered on the amount of twitter usage in a city, but also data that includes specific
					Twitter content.
