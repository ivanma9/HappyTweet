					#Thoughts
					<p>
						As we have mentioned, social media is an extremely central part of
						today’s world. We were initially interested in how this can impact
						people’s mental states after learning more about the various studies
						that have suggested that social media might impact people’s lives
						negatively. A
						<a
							href="https://time.com/4882372/social-media-facebook-instagram-unhappy/"
							>Times</a
						>
						article cites a 2017 study by researchers Vannuci et al. that found
						that increased time on social media was connected to higher levels
						of anxiety (Heid). The same article also brings up the idea of
						“technology overload” (Heid). More time spent on our phones on these
						social media platforms are thought to not be very healthy for your
						brain. Thus, there is some basis for the idea that social media can
						negatively affect people’s mental states, which justifies our
						project’s aim to explore how emotions might be reflected in social
						media.

					#Inspiration
					<p>
						The structure of this project was inspired by other researchers who
						have done Twitter analysis as well. A common project approach we
						discovered in our research was one that centered around sentiment
						analysis. These project designs, such as the instructions offered
						<a
							href="https://medium.com/swlh/tweet-sentiment-analysis-using-python-for-complete-beginners-4aeb4456040"
							>here,</a
						>
						used different methods to collect tweets and assign different
						numerical scores to them, depending on if they were more positive,
						negative, or neutral. We applied this idea by searching for tweets
						in Twarc that were more positive (tweets with the words “happy” and
						“love” in them), neutral (tweets with the words “okay” and “alright”
						in them), and negative (tweets with the words “sad” and”hate” in
						them).
					</p>

					<p>
						This
						<a href="https://qz.com/862325/the-great-american-word-mapper/"
							>Word Mapper</a
						>
						project as well as
						<a href="https://isogloss.shinyapps.io/isogloss/">this</a> also
						inspired us to use Twarc to create our own dataset and locate our
						own tweets. These projects allow you to type in any word and see
						where tweets relating to that term have been tweeted. By following
						this same idea and using Twarc, we were able to incorporate data that
						takes into account the content and frequency of tweets.
					
					</p>

				<div id="findings">#Findings</div>
				<p>
					In general, we were able to find more positive-leveled tweets (tweets with the
					word “happy” and tweets with the word “love”). This could be because the location
					in which we completed the Twarc searches were for cities with higher happiness scores.
					This would suggest that social media might in some way be reflective of emotional states,
					have some correlation to general happiness/emotions. This is a great sign because in 2020 there were
					several instances of the saddest periods ever recorded on twitter. The coronavirus outbreak combined with 
					civil unrest events such as the killing of Geore Floyd and subsequent Black Lives Matter movement resulted in a
					record decline in mood across the US. Seeing these elevated numbers is an indication that positive moods are rising.
