				#About the project
				<p>
					Technological developments in the 21st century have transformed how we 
					interact with the world and each other, and social media platforms have 
					been at the forefront of this process. The centrality of social media has 
					reformed how we as humans connect and communicate; important life events have 
					been reduced to likable photos, heart-felt messages have been replaced with 
					captions, and thoughts and emotions have been compressed into hashtags. The 
					following statistics speak to these realities: about 45% of the population
					constitutes as social media users; people spend 2 hours and 25 minutes using 
					social media per day(smartinsights.com); 500 million tweets are sent out every day,
					on average (brandwatch.com). These statistics make clear that social media plays a 
					very central and fundamental role in today’s society.

				</p>
				<p>
					With this in mind, we are interested in digging deeper into how social media usage
					might be associated with happiness levels, but more specifically, how people express
					their emotions using social media. 

				</p>
				<p>
					To look into this further, we have chosen Twitter as the social media platform of focus.
					We have designed a project aimed at finding out if there is a correlation between 
					happinesslevels of different US cities and Twitter usage of these cities that is specific
					to emotionally-charged Tweets.
				</p>
				<p>
					For this project we have utilized two datasets, one which includes Twitter data that we
					compiled ourselves and one with data that includes happiness indicators and scores of U.S.
					cities from Wallethub. The former was collected using Twarc. In Twarc, we completed various
					queries for each city included in our Wallethub dataset. We searched for tweets reflective 
					of differing happiness levels. For higher levels of happiness we searched for tweets that 
					included the words “happy” and “love.” For more neutral levels of happiness we searched for
					tweets that included the words “okay” and “alright.” For lower levels of happiness we searched
					for tweets that included the words “sad” and “hate.” We chose these words because we felt 
					that they each correlated to differing levels of emotion. We compiled all of this information
					into a larger dataset that recorded the number that each word was found in tweets from all
					the included cities.

				</p>
				<p>
					The latter dataset was compiled using various already existing reports with measures 
					reflective of the following three categories: (1) emotion and physical well-being, 
					(2) income and employment, and (3) community and environment. Example measures include
					happiness/depression indexes and suicide rates, poverty rates and income information, 
					and hate-crime data, respectively. The dates of data used ranges from 2010 to 2014. 
				</p>
				<p>
					By mapping botched datasets, we hope to see what kinds of content is being tweeted
					for each city with a happiness score.

							<p>Content Creator</p>
							I am a third-year sociology student minoring in digital humanities
							and art history. In my free time I serve as the co-captain of the
							UCLA Sailing Team. When I graduate, I am interested in pursuing a
							career in digital marketing and brand strategy. For this project,
							I will be overseeing the writing and design process. I will be the
							one writing up anything for the website, including introductions,
							background information, research, etc. As for helping with the
							design, the plan is to draft ideas in Figma, a designing platform,
							so that Ivan can go in and utilize the actual code for my designs.

							<p>Web Developer</p>
							I am a third-year/first year transfer computer science student. I
							love to play soccer on a competitive level and munch on all sorts
							of food. I will be conducting most of the coding for this project.
							Piecing together our creative ideas into a web application that
							integrates thick mapping is a goal that I want to contribute for
							our project. I hope to collaborate with my group mates in Figma
							and keep and maintain good user design and experience for the
							interactivity of our site.

							<p>Team Leader</p>
							I am a fourth year materials science engineering student. I like
							to play tennis and am interested in jobs in product development
							after I graduate. For this project, I will be the team leader. I
							am going to coordinate all of our meetings, keep us on track, as
							well as bridging the gap between the coding and writing processes.
							In addition, I will be doing background research after our data
							analysis so we can come to a further understanding about the
							project.
