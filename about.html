				#About the project
				<p>
					Technological developments in the 21st century have transformed how we
					interact with the world and each other, and social media platforms
					have been at the forefront of this process. The centrality of social
					media has reformed how we as humans connect and communicate; important
					life events have been reduced to likable photos, heart-felt messages
					have been replaced with captions, and thoughts and emotions have been
					compressed into hashtags. The following statistics speak to these
					realities: about 45% of the population constitutes as social media
					users; people spend 2 hours and 25 minutes using social media per day
					(smartinsights.com); 500 million tweets are sent out every day, on
					average (brandwatch.com). These statistics make clear that social
					media plays a very central and fundamental role in today’s society.
				</p>
				<p>
					With this in mind, the question then is: how does social media usage
					affect members of society, mentally? We think that this question is
					especially prevalent now more than ever, as more and more of our time
					is spent on screens due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Our goal of this
					project is to dig deeper into this question.
				</p>
				<p>
					In order to do so, we have chosen two datasets, one with twitter data
					that includes user location and tweet content information, and one
					with data that includes happiness indicators and scores of U.S. cities
					from Wallethub. The former was compiled by the researchers Z. Cheng,
					J. Caverlee, and K. Lee, who scraped Twitter content from September
					2009 to January 2010. The latter was compiled using various already
					existing reports with measures reflective of the following three
					categories: (1) emotion and physical well-being, (2) income and
					employment, and (3) community and environment. Example measures
					include happiness/depression indexes and suicide rates, poverty rates
					and income information, and hate-crime data, respectively. The dates
					of data used ranges from 2010 to 2014.
				</p>
				<p>
					By mapping both datasets, we hope to see if there is a correlation
					between the cities with lower happiness scores and with greater
					Twitter usage. (Note that while these time frames don’t match
					precisely with the dates of the Twitter data, both datasets will still
					give us a general idea of this correlation). We are trying to answer
					our original question by seeing if the cities that have more Twitter
					users have lower happiness scores and indexes. Ultimately, this
					project is for anyone who utilizes social media on a daily basis. We
					want to bring attention to the potential negative effects of using
					these platforms so that, hopefully, people can make educated decisions
					about how to spend their time in more constructive ways.

							<p>Content Creator</p>
							I am a third-year sociology student minoring in digital humanities
							and art history. In my free time I serve as the co-captain of the
							UCLA Sailing Team. When I graduate, I am interested in pursuing a
							career in digital marketing and brand strategy. For this project,
							I will be overseeing the writing and design process. I will be the
							one writing up anything for the website, including introductions,
							background information, research, etc. As for helping with the
							design, the plan is to draft ideas in Figma, a designing platform,
							so that Ivan can go in and utilize the actual code for my designs.

							<p>Web Developer</p>
							I am a third-year/first year transfer computer science student. I
							love to play soccer on a competitive level and munch on all sorts
							of food. I will be conducting most of the coding for this project.
							Piecing together our creative ideas into a web application that
							integrates thick mapping is a goal that I want to contribute for
							our project. I hope to collaborate with my group mates in Figma
							and keep and maintain good user design and experience for the
							interactivity of our site.

							<p>Team Leader</p>
							I am a fourth year materials science engineering student. I like
							to play tennis and am interested in jobs in product development
							after I graduate. For this project, I will be the team leader. I
							am going to coordinate all of our meetings, keep us on track, as
							well as bridging the gap between the coding and writing processes.
							In addition, I will be doing background research after our data
							analysis so we can come to a further understanding about the
							project.
