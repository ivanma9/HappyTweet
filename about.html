							I am a third-year sociology student minoring in digital humanities
							and art history. In my free time I serve as the co-captain of the
							UCLA Sailing Team. When I graduate, I am interested in pursuing a
							career in digital marketing and brand strategy. For this project,
							I will be overseeing the writing and design process. I will be the
							one writing up anything for the website, including introductions,
							background information, research, etc. As for helping with the
							design, the plan is to draft ideas in Figma, a designing platform,
							so that Ivan can go in and utilize the actual code for my designs.

							I am a third-year/first year transfer computer science student. I
							love to play soccer on a competitive level and munch on all sorts
							of food. I will be conducting most of the coding for this project.
							Piecing together our creative ideas into a web application that
							integrates thick mapping is a goal that I want to contribute for
							our project. I hope to collaborate with my group mates in Figma
							and keep and maintain good user design and experience for the
							interactivity of our site.

							I am a fourth year materials science engineering student. I like
							to play tennis and am interested in jobs in product development
							after I graduate. For this project, I will be the team leader. I
							am going to coordinate all of our meetings, keep us on track, as
							well as bridging the gap between the coding and writing processes.
							In addition, I will be doing background research after our data
							analysis so we can come to a further understanding about the
							project.
