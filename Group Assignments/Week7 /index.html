			<p>
				This is a choropleth map of happiness scores assigned to different US
				cities. The data represented was collected by Wallethub from various
				reports and surveys reporting different measures reflecting happiness.
				The researchers assigned weights to each measure analyzed to calculate
				an overall happiness score for each city. The map represents average
				happiness scores of the multiple cities recorded for each state. Each
				state is categorized into different colors based off these scores. Red
				colors represent lower average happiness scores, meaning lower levels of
				happiness, and green scores represent higher happiness scores, meaning
				higher levels of happiness.
