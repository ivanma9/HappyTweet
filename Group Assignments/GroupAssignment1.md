## Group Repository
https://github.com/ivanma9/HappyTweet
## Introduction:
Our group name is “Happy Tweet” and our project looks at social media usage (specifically Twitter usage) and world happiness data. We are trying to see if there is a relationship between trends in world happiness scores and social media use.
## Team Members:
# MJ Howland - Content Creator

I am a third-year sociology student minoring in digital humanities and art history. In my free time I serve as the co-captain of the UCLA Sailing Team. When I graduate, I am interested in pursuing a career in digital marketing and brand strategy.
For this project, I will be overseeing the writing and design process. I will be the one writing up anything for the website, including introductions, background information, research, etc. As for helping with the design, the plan is to draft ideas in Figma, a designing platform, so that Ivan can go in and utilize the actual code for my designs. 
# Ivan Ma - Web Developer

I am a third-year/first year transfer computer science student. I love to play soccer on a competitive level and munch on all sorts of food.
I will be conducting most of the coding for this project. Piecing together our creative ideas into a web application that integrates thick mapping is a goal that I want to contribute for our project. I hope to collaborate with my group mates in Figma and keep and maintain good user design and experience for the interactivity of our site. 
# Josephine Meyer-Hogan - Team Leader

I am a fourth year materials science engineering student. I like to play tennis and am interested in jobs in product development after I graduate. 
For this project, I will be the team leader. I am going to coordinate all of our meetings, keep us on track, as well as bridging the gap between the coding and writing processes. In addition, I will be doing background research after our data analysis so we can come to a further understanding about the project. 
Overview:
Our group wants to investigate the connection between world happiness and social media usage. We want to map world happiness data from (insert year) as well as twitter hashtags/usage by location to see if there is a correlation between a location’s general happiness levels and how much people in those locations use social media. The social media platform that we will be focusing on is Twitter. We think that this topic is especially important considering today’s increased dependency on social media (and technology in general as a result of Covid-19).
## Methodology:
Web mapping is a very diverse method of communicating often used to tell stories, answer questions, and represent data. A map is able to portray information in a way that more traditional data graphics cannot. The perspective that comes with viewing data geographically is very unique and discovering correlations in the data becomes much easier. There is also often data that needs to be analyzed with the location in mind, as in our case. In our investigation, we are looking for a correlation between happiness and social media use in the US. This data utilizes geolocation as the foundation for data collection. Location provides a common ground that allows us to analyze and compare multiple data sets in order to find similarities. 
## Workflow:
| Week | Phase | Tasks To Complete |
| ---- | ----- | ----------------- | 
| 2 | Brainstorming | Group project proposal |
| 3 | Research | <ul> <li> Do background research on our topic so that we can include relevant information on the website </li></ul> |
| 4 | Prep | <ul><li> Data cleaning / refining</li><li> Finalizing the objectives we want to accomplish / what we want the end product to include</li><ul> |
| 5 | Starting to Code + Design | <ul> <li> Start coding website </li><li> Start coding maps</li> <li> Start working in figma to create design </li></ul>|
| 6 | Continue Coding + Design | Continue Above |
| 7 | Continue Coding + Design + Start Writing | 
<ul> <li>Continue Above </li><li> Start drafting writing for the website </li></ul>|
| 8 | Continue Coding + Design + Writing | Continue Above |
| 9 | Start to finalize | Start making edits and making sure all site pages have their proper content |
| 10 | Continue finalizing | By now we should have the website pretty much completed and just making last minute edits |
| Finals | Final | Present to the class |

 
## Technical Scope:
We will be using Git for our repository for easy collaboration. Leaflet library will be used for our mapping alongside Javascript to pair with it. HTML will be used for adding elements to the website in an organized fashion. Bootstrap and CSS will be used for styling and design.
## Data:
We will be using the Twitter API to track posts and geolocations. In addition, we will be using data from the world happiness reports to track the correlation between location and mood. Our Twitter API will allow us to retrieve relevant data of users and their posts and geo-location. These two datasets will link together to model happiness among certain locations based on the tweets sent in that area and user activity.
